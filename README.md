## How to Use these Web Components in React

## Available Web Components
Each Web Component is hosted on a CDN that begins like this: https://cc3cdndev.blob.core.windows.net/xsg/src/
To access a Web Component simply append the component name to the end of the CDN url with the ".js" file name suffix.
For example, https://cc3cdndev.blob.core.windows.net/xsg/src/contentBlock.js will retrieve the "Content Block" web component.

Current List of Components:
* contentBlock
* feedbackBanner
* myNav
* pageTitle
* xelloButton

## Improvements to Make
